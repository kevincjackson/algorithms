# Algorithms
## History
- Formalized by Church and Turing in the 1930's.
- Most algorithms have been discovered recently!
- Important algorithms are discovered by undergrads in algorithm courses!
- "I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a
good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more
important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers
worry about data structures and their relationships." - Linus Torvalds
- "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs." - Niklaus Wirth
