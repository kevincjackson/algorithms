# Big O

## What
- A system which simplifies a mathematical equation down to the largest order.
- O comes from German word *ordnung*, meaning order. It may be helpful to just think of Big O as Big Order Notation.

## Why
Big O is useful for describing the speed of a computer solution (algorithm performance).

## Who
- Paul Bachmann, German Mathematician
- Edmund Landau, German Mathematician
- Hardy and Littlewood, British Mathematicians
- Donald Knuth, American Computer Scientist

## Where
Germany, England, and the United States.

## When
- Paul Bachmann introduced the O symbol in 1894.
- Edmund Landau added the Big O Notation in 1909.
- Hardy and Littlewood added the Omega notation in 1914.
- Donald Knuth popularized the system in the 1970's and added the Theta notation.

## How
1. Add different steps
2. Drop constants
3. Drop non-dominate terms.
4. Do *not* drop different terms.
